Description: Provides implementations of rule pruning algorithms based on the "Classification Based on Associations" (CBA). It can be used for building classification models from association rules. Rules are pruned in the order of precedence given by the sort criteria and a default rule is added. CBA was originally proposed by Liu, B. Hsu, W. and Ma, Y (1998).
